# BookChook

## Personal Book Database
Add books you own and then search for them to check if you own it or not. I find this to be a real problem. What the hell do you do with duplicate books!? 

### How do you even

- virtualenv myenv
- Activate the virtual env
- pip install -r mysite/requirements.txt
- python manage.py runserver
- Point browser to localhost:8000
